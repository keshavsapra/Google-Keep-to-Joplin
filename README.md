# Google Keep to Joplin Converter

A Python script to convert exported Google Keep notes (in HTML format) into Markdown files (.md) suitable for importing into the Joplin note-taking application.

## Description

Google Keep allows exporting notes as HTML files. Joplin can import notes from Markdown files. This script bridges the gap by parsing the HTML structure of exported Keep notes, converting the content (including titles, text, and checkboxes) to Markdown, and saving each note as a separate `.md` file.

## Features

* **GUI Folder Selection:** Uses a graphical interface to easily select the folder containing your Keep HTML files.
* **HTML Parsing:** Extracts the title and main content from Keep's HTML structure.
* **Markdown Conversion:** Converts HTML content to clean Markdown.
* **Checkbox Handling:** Correctly converts Google Keep checkboxes (checked and unchecked) into Markdown task lists (`- [x]` or `- [ ]`).
* **Title Fallback:** Uses the HTML filename as the note title if an explicit title isn't found in the HTML.
* **Filename Sanitization:** Creates valid filenames from note titles.
* **Organized Output:** Saves the converted `.md` files into a dedicated `converted files` subfolder within your selected directory.
* **Basic Error Handling:** Provides feedback during the conversion process and reports basic errors.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Required Python libraries: `BeautifulSoup4` and `Markdownify`

## Installation

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get the script file (`convert_keep_to_markdown.py` or your chosen name) from this repository.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    pip install beautifulsoup4 markdownify
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Export from Google Keep:** Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) and export your Google Keep notes. Make sure to select HTML format. Download and unzip the export file.
2.  **Run the Script:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and run it:
    ```bash
    python convert_keep_to_markdown.py
    ```
    (Replace `convert_keep_to_markdown.py` with the actual filename if you renamed it).
3.  **Select Folder:** A file dialog window will appear. Navigate to and select the folder containing the `.html` files you extracted from the Google Takeout zip file (usually a folder named `Keep`).
4.  **Conversion:** The script will process the HTML files and create a new subfolder named `converted files` inside the folder you selected. The converted `.md` files will be saved there. Check the terminal output for progress and any potential errors.
5.  **Import into Joplin:**
    * Open Joplin.
    * Go to `File` > `Import` > `Markdown (Directory)`.
    * Select the `converted files` folder created by the script.
    * Joplin will import the notes.

## How it Works

The script iterates through each `.html` file in the specified input directory. For each file:
1.  It uses `BeautifulSoup4` to parse the HTML structure.
2.  It looks for specific `div` elements (typically with class `title` and `note-content` or `content`) to extract the note's title and body.
3.  It specifically processes list items (`<li>`) containing checkboxes (`<input type="checkbox">`) and converts them into Markdown task list syntax before general conversion.
4.  It uses the `markdownify` library to convert the main content HTML into Markdown.
5.  It prepends the note title as a Level 1 Markdown heading (`# Title`).
6.  It saves the resulting Markdown text into a `.md` file within the `converted files` output directory, using a sanitized version of the note title as the filename.

## Limitations

* The script relies on the specific HTML structure generated by Google Takeout for Keep notes. If Google changes this structure significantly, the script may need updates.
* Complex HTML formatting beyond basic text, lists, and checkboxes might not be perfectly converted.
* Embedded images or attachments in Keep notes are not processed by this script; only the text content is converted.
